# Assignment 3

## Latheesh Mangeri - 1002116009

## Posterior Proabilites and Bayesian Networks

Programming Language:
---------------------

Python 3.9.7

Code Structure:
---------------

The code consists of a two Python script, compute_a_posteriori.py and bnet.py, which implements the tasks provided for assignment 3.

The compute_a_posteriori.py task in this part is to implement a system that:

* Can determine the posterior probability of different hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations.
* Can determine the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations.

How to Run the Code:
--------------------

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download the 1002116009_assmt3.zip file to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where python scripts are located using the 'cd' command.
5. Run the code using the following command format for Task 1 implementation:
   python compute_a_posteriori.py `LCLCLCLC`
6. The results for compute_a_posteriori.py will be saved in a created result.txt file.
7. For the bnet.py the probability will be directly displayed on the terminal.
8. Task 2 implementation:
   python bnet.py Bf At Mt
