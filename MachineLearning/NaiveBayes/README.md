## Introduction
Bayesian learning for classifying news text articles:

 

Naive Bayes classifiers are among the most successful known algorithms for learning to classify text documents. We will provide a dataset containing 20,000 newsgroup messages drawn from the 20 newsgroups.

The dataset contains 1000 documents from each of the 20 newsgroups.

1. Please download the data from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-11/www/naive-bayes.html Links to an external site.(Newsgroup Data)

2. Please use half data as training data, and the other half as testing data.
